<h1>A basic HTML template</h1>
    <p>This is the beginning of my long and wonderful journey into JavaScript programming and mapping.</p>
    
<h2>Reaction to the Floating Sheep Manifesto</h2>
    
    <p>I enjoyed reading this manifesto and I feel like it's a great introduction to a lot of the issues involved in the world of making maps that I'd never considered before. I live in East Africa and the skewed nature of the Mercator Projection is something that I'm well aware of. I've seen plenty of images with China, USA, and a lot of Europe displayed inside the 'actual' size of the Africa continent and this 'map lie' is a source of frustration for many people. However, most of the other points raised are pretty new to me and it's been interesting to be able to explore these and reflect on them for the first time.</p>
    
    <p>I'd say my map making brain lies somewhere between the worlds of cartographer and coder. While I don't have any experience writing JavaScript, I do have experience using online tools to create maps. I even managed to incorporate Google maps onto some of my first websites about 10 years ago. It was a lot of trial and error, some pulling out of my hair, and plenty of swearing but I managed to somehow embed a very simple Google street map onto my website about London that marked the locations of the major neighbourhoods. As an end user, I've seen online mapping technology grow over the years and I'm excited by the opportunities that lay ahead with the constantly improving technology.</p>
    
    <p>While I don't know much about the history of maps or best practice beyond what I learned in MAP671, I would say that aesthetics and the user's experience while using a map are very important to me. My interest in making maps was piqued after I somehow stumbled through making a printed tourist map of Kigali, Rwanda without knowing a single thing about making a printed map. Despite having zero experience or education in cartographic best practices I feel like I managed to create a good product. A badly designed map makes my soul sad so perhaps I lean a bit more towards the cartographer side of things but I also see the exciting possibilities available to the coder and would hope to learn how to master these tools.</p>
    
    <p>While all of the manifesto points caused me to pause and ponder, I think that "Pretty maps are better than ugly maps. But ugly maps will do in a pinch" is the most problematic for me to come to grips with. I really love design and seeing a map that conveys excellent information done in an ugly way seems like such a waste to me. But if the map is functional and full of good information and the ugliness doen't hinder the user's ability to use it, how much do the aesthetics really matter? If the map's main goal is to convey information to the reader and it accomplishes that goal, then I grudgingly admit that that's good enough.</p>
    
    <p>Most people reading maps do so to acquire information and don't know the first thing about 'proper' cartographic rules and best practice and probably don't care. If the information is conveyed clearly, then I think that's a starting point with room for improvement if time and skills allow. Perhaps the map won't win any cartographic awards, but if it accomplishes its goal (and the goal isn't to win any awards...) then map snobs like me should relax and acknowledge that a map can be ugly and still be useful. I equate a useful ugly map to Craigslist. That site's aesthetics would make any web designer weep but it's the information that's contained within the site that people want and so, as long as the site's design doesn't hinder the access to that information, I don't see the problem. Same thing with an ugly map.</p>
    
    <p>I'm more of an entrepreneurial type and not sure I'm really looking for a mapping career but as I continue to learn I would like to put a priority on working towards improving map accuracy within the cities in Africa that I'm familiar with. I've started already with printed maps of Kigali and Addis Ababa and I'd like to take the data I've gathered and move it into useful and accurate online maps of these cities.</p>
