# Kirsty Henderson's MAP672 Modules

## My Learning Objectives

1. Gain knowledge of and some experience using the main tools in the online mapping world like CartoDB, Leaflet, Mapbox, and maybe other handy things I don't even know exist yet.

2. Expand on my knowledge of HTML and CSS and see how they connect to and work with Javascript.

3. Become an online mapping JavaScript ninja. Or at least get to a suitable level with JS to be able to confidently and continually build on my knowledge base as I tackle new projects.

4. Continue to learn about best practices in cartography.

5. Keep learning how to use maps to effectively communicate ideas and information in the clearest possible way.

6. Constantly brainstorm about how I can use the skills I'm learning in each module as a part of my own projects on my current websites and possibly future app maps.
